    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Text is one of the most widespread forms of sequence data. It can be understood as either a sequence of charactors or a sequence of words, but it's most common to work at level of words. Text-sequence processing includes following applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications of deep learning for text data:**\n",
    "1. Document classification\n",
    "2. Articles lebelling\n",
    "3. Sentiment analysis\n",
    "4. Author identification\n",
    "5. Quention-answering\n",
    "6. Language detection\n",
    "7. Translation Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "- In true sense `deep learning models map the statistical structure of written language,` which is sufficient to solve many simple textual tasks and problems.\n",
    "- Deep learning for natural-language processing is `pattern recognition applied to words, sequence, and paragraphs,` in much similar way that computer vision is pattern recognition applied to pixels.\n",
    "- Deep-learning models don't take input as text like other models they only work with numeric tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three techniques to vectorize the text data:**\n",
    "1. Segment text into words, and convert word into a vector\n",
    "2. Segment text into charactors, and transform each chractors into a vector.\n",
    "3. Extract n-grams of words, and transform each n-grams into a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are many ways one can convert text to vector and it depends on what models one is using along with time or resources utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical workflow to model text data for deep learning algorithms:**\n",
    "1. Tokenization\n",
    "2. One-Hot encoding or word indexing\n",
    "3. Pad sequencing \n",
    "4. Embedding layers\n",
    "5. Corresponding word vector\n",
